<p>We work backwards. If he had 8 candies at the end, then before he gave candies to his sister he had 12 candies. This means that at the end of Halloween he had 18 candies, so before he gave candies to his brother he had 20 candies. Therefore, at the start he had <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/e/2/8/e28ad42e48416fb1b4129149ec0c2e6bb78fc0a6.png" class="latex" alt="$\boxed{\textbf{(A)} 30}$" style="vertical-align: -10px" width="59" height="28" />
