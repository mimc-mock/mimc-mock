<p>A student council must select a two-person welcoming committee and a three-person planning committee from among its members. There are exactly <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/f/c/6/fc606f7f1e530731ab4f1cc364c01dc64a4455ee.png" class="latex" alt="$10$" style="vertical-align: 0px" width="17" height="13" /> ways to select a two-person team for the welcoming committee. It is possible for students to serve on both committees. In how many different ways can a three-person planning committee be selected?

<p>Let the number of students on the council be <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/2/6/e/26eeb5258ca5099acf8fe96b2a1049c48c89a5e6.png" class="latex" alt="$x$" width="10" height="8" />.  To select a two-person committee, we can select a "first person" and a "second person." There are <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/2/6/e/26eeb5258ca5099acf8fe96b2a1049c48c89a5e6.png" class="latex" alt="$x$" width="10" height="8" /> choices to select a first person; subsequently, there are <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/d/4/b/d4baf6d4b1cfa69b68b3204b5e2eba0c5755fe20.png" class="latex" alt="$x-1$" style="vertical-align: 0px" width="40" height="12" /> choices for the second person. This gives a preliminary count of <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/0/9/e/09eeabed1907d9846cbc55814b50f7fbf148f3ee.png" class="latex" alt="$x(x-1)$" style="vertical-align: -4px" width="64" height="18" /> ways to choose a two-person committee. However, this accounts for the order of committees. To understand this, suppose that Alice and Bob are two students in the council. If we choose Alice and then Bob, that is the same as choosing Bob and then Alice and so latter and former arrangements would be considered the same. Therefore, we have to divide by <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/4/1/c/41c544263a265ff15498ee45f7392c5f86c6d151.png" class="latex" alt="$2$" width="8" height="12" /> to account for overcounting. Thus, there are <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/0/f/1/0f18d7f794fa014075a747a194538bd11af0d58d.png" class="latex" alt="$\dfrac{x(x-1)} 2=10$" style="vertical-align: -12px" width="112" height="38" /> ways to choose the two-person committee. Solving this equation, we find that <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/7/9/0/79069377f91364c2f87a64e5f9f562a091c8a6c1.png" class="latex" alt="$5$" width="8" height="12" /> and <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/7/2/d/72d85c6959aaabfff6e0104544ff25c1445f3f1e.png" class="latex" alt="$-4$" style="vertical-align: 0px" width="23" height="12" /> are integer solutions. <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/7/2/d/72d85c6959aaabfff6e0104544ff25c1445f3f1e.png" class="latex" alt="$-4$" style="vertical-align: 0px" width="23" height="12" /> is a ridiculous situation, so there are <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/7/9/0/79069377f91364c2f87a64e5f9f562a091c8a6c1.png" class="latex" alt="$5$" width="8" height="12" /> people on the student council. The solution is <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/0/c/1/0c1241acdf3d52f2b2197f468c4931fb8a3c6b44.png" class="latex" alt="$\dbinom 5 3=10\implies \boxed{\textbf{A}}$" style="vertical-align: -22px" width="155" height="53" />.
