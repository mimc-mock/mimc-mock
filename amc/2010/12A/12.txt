<p>In a magical swamp there are two species of talking amphibians: toads, whose statements are always true, and frogs, whose statements are always false. Four amphibians, Brian, Chris, LeRoy, and Mike live together in this swamp, and they make the following statements.
</p><p>Brian: "Mike and I are different species."
</p><p>Chris: "LeRoy is a frog."
</p><p>LeRoy: "Chris is a frog."
</p><p>Mike: "Of the four of us, at least two are toads."
</p><p>How many of these amphibians are frogs?

<p>Start with Brian. If he is a toad, he tells the truth, hence Mike is a frog. If Brian is a frog, he lies, hence Mike is a frog, too. Thus Mike must be a frog.
</p><p>As Mike is a frog, his statement is false, hence there is at most one toad.
</p><p>As there is at most one toad, at least one of Chris and LeRoy is a frog. But then the other one tells the truth, and therefore is a toad.
</p><p>Hence we must have one toad and <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/0/2/a/02af645f20a9874a363187aa704686ebf6104a6a.png" class="latex" alt="$\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 3}$" style="vertical-align: -10px" width="55" height="28" /> frogs.
