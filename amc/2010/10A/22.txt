<p>Eight points are chosen on a circle, and chords are drawn connecting every pair of points. No three chords intersect in a single point inside the circle. How many triangles with all three vertices in the interior of the circle are created?

<p>To choose a chord, we know that two points must be chosen. This implies that for three chords to create a triangle and not intersect at a single point, six points need to be chosen. We also know that for any six points we pick, there is only <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/d/c/e/dce34f4dfb2406144304ad0d6106c5382ddd1446.png" class="latex" alt="$1$" style="vertical-align: 0px" width="8" height="12" /> way to connect the points such that a triangle is formed in the circle's interior (this is because we want  no two chords to be parallel ~Williamgolly). Therefore, the answer is <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/2/a/b/2abffaadff61048f9208f40aec6d40a4f594a599.png" class="latex" alt="${{8}\choose{6}}$" style="vertical-align: -22px" width="33" height="53" />, which is equivalent to <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/d/9/7/d9799322252edfa299872d8fea9ec0e57c4bc348.png" class="latex" alt="$\boxed{\textbf{(A) }28}$" style="vertical-align: -10px" width="65" height="28" />.
