<p>Rachel and Robert run on a circular track.  Rachel runs counterclockwise and completes a lap every 90 seconds, and Robert runs clockwise and completes a lap every 80 seconds.  Both start from the same line at the same time.  At some random time between 10 minutes and 11 minutes after they begin to run, a photographer standing inside the track takes a picture that shows one-fourth of the track, centered on the starting line.  What is the probability that both Rachel and Robert are in the picture?
