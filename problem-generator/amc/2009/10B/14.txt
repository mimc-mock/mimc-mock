On each successive day she adds another quart of the same mix of seeds without removing any seeds that are left.  Each day the birds eat only <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/9/6/6/96633b73a86b9d9110e1ff824fce08def96ca296.png" class="latex" alt="$25\%$" style="vertical-align: -1px" width="32" height="14" /> of the millet in the feeder, but they eat all of the other seeds.
