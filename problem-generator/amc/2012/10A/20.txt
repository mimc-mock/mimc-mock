Each unit square is painted either white or black with each color being equally likely, chosen independently and at random. The square is then rotated <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/a/4/c/a4cd45b3e5e4114d6f850997684da2d285b19541.png" class="latex" alt="$90\,^{\circ}$" width="27" height="13" /> clockwise about its center, and every white square in a position formerly occupied by a black square is painted black. The colors of all other squares are left unchanged. What is the probability the grid is now entirely black?
