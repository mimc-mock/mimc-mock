<p>Alex, Mel, and Chelsea play a game that has <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/6/0/1/601a7806cbfad68196c43a4665871f8c3186802e.png" class="latex" alt="$6$" width="8" height="12" /> rounds.  In each round there is a single winner, and the outcomes of the rounds are independent.  For each round the probability that Alex wins is <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/2/f/9/2f960094315d60883495f9b74148e17487ee9584.png" class="latex" alt="$\frac{1}{2}$" style="vertical-align: -12px" width="11" height="37" />, and Mel is twice as likely to win as Chelsea.  What is the probability that Alex wins three rounds, Mel wins two rounds, and Chelsea wins one round?
