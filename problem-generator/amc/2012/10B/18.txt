<p>Suppose that one of every 500 people in a certain population has a particular disease, which displays no symptoms. A blood test is available for screening for this disease. For a person who has this disease, the test always turns out positive. For a person who does not have the disease, however, there is a <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/0/b/0/0b04a3bd51b4c6a454c3aae545a1dbc6a5bff05d.png" class="latex" alt="$2\%$" style="vertical-align: -1px" width="23" height="14" /> false positive rate--in other words, for such people, <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/3/0/6/30696f72e40dac44ba3d77958f23e54518505ca9.png" class="latex" alt="$98\%$" style="vertical-align: -1px" width="32" height="14" /> of the time the test will turn out negative, but <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/0/b/0/0b04a3bd51b4c6a454c3aae545a1dbc6a5bff05d.png" class="latex" alt="$2\%$" style="vertical-align: -1px" width="23" height="14" /> of the time the test will turn out positive and will incorrectly indicate that the person has the disease. Let <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/3/6/f/36f73fc1312ee0349b3f3a0f3bd9eb5504339011.png" class="latex" alt="$p$" style="vertical-align: -3px" width="10" height="11" /> be the probability that a person who is chosen at random from this population and gets a positive test result actually has the disease. Which of the following is closest to <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/3/6/f/36f73fc1312ee0349b3f3a0f3bd9eb5504339011.png" class="latex" alt="$p$" style="vertical-align: -3px" width="10" height="11" />?
