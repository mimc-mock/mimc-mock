<p>Anna enjoys dinner at a restaurant in Washington, D.C., where the sales tax on meals is 10%. She leaves a 15% tip on the price of her meal before the sales tax is added, and the tax is calculated on the pre-tip amount. She spends a total of 27.50 dollars for dinner. What is the cost of her dinner without tax or tip in dollars?
