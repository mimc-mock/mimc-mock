<p>Goldbach's conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers (for example, <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/8/5/0/850bc493353a5591da0e708c4186206ea01a4d79.png" class="latex" alt="$2016=13+2003$" style="vertical-align: -1px" width="136" height="14" />). So far, no one has been able to prove that the conjecture is true, and no one has found a counterexample to show that the conjecture is false. What would a counterexample consist of?
