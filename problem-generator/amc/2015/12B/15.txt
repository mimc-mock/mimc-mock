She is certain that she will get As in both Mathematics and Science, and at least a C in each of English and History. She thinks she has a <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/d/d/6/dd67695beb95237e0f69e5970c768f26c95d5532.png" class="latex" alt="$\tfrac{1}{6}$" style="vertical-align: -6px" width="9" height="21" /> chance of getting an A in English, and a <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/c/8/4/c84a414e9655bf25b41aebc8c9f7bcb651acf2fb.png" class="latex" alt="$\tfrac{1}{4}$" style="vertical-align: -6px" width="9" height="21" /> chance of getting a B.
