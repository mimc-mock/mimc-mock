<p>Alice, Bob, and Charlie were on a hike and were wondering how far away the nearest town was. When Alice said, "We are at least <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/6/0/1/601a7806cbfad68196c43a4665871f8c3186802e.png" class="latex" alt="$6$" width="8" height="12" /> miles away," Bob replied, "We are at most <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/7/9/0/79069377f91364c2f87a64e5f9f562a091c8a6c1.png" class="latex" alt="$5$" width="8" height="12" /> miles away." Charlie then remarked, "Actually the nearest town is at most <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/c/7/c/c7cab1a05e1e0c1d51a6a219d96577a16b7abf9d.png" class="latex" alt="$4$" style="vertical-align: 0px" width="9" height="12" /> miles away."

Let <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/9/6/a/96ab646de7704969b91c76a214126b45f2b07b25.png" class="latex" alt="$d$" width="9" height="12" /> be the distance in miles to the nearest town. Which of the following intervals is the set of all possible values of <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/9/6/a/96ab646de7704969b91c76a214126b45f2b07b25.png" class="latex" alt="$d$" width="9" height="12" />?
