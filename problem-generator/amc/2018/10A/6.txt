<p>Sangho uploaded a video to a website where viewers can vote that they like or dislike a video. Each video begins with a score of <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/b/c/1/bc1f9d9bf8a1b606a4188b5ce9a2af1809e27a89.png" class="latex" alt="$0$" width="8" height="12" />, and the score increases by <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/d/c/e/dce34f4dfb2406144304ad0d6106c5382ddd1446.png" class="latex" alt="$1$" style="vertical-align: 0px" width="8" height="12" /> for each like vote and decreases by <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/d/c/e/dce34f4dfb2406144304ad0d6106c5382ddd1446.png" class="latex" alt="$1$" style="vertical-align: 0px" width="8" height="12" /> for each dislike vote. At one point Sangho saw that his video had a score of <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/b/f/c/bfcfee7bd8a5e15e5f6b7881c138de43651572a9.png" class="latex" alt="$90$" width="17" height="12" />, and that <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/f/f/1/ff169c8eb4e8e515216bcd0f6f207a78af94c8b4.png" class="latex" alt="$65\%$" style="vertical-align: -1px" width="32" height="14" /> of the votes cast on his video were like votes.
