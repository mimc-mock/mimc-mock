<p>Keiko walks once around a track at exactly the same constant speed every day. The sides of the track are straight, and the ends are semicircles. The track has a width of <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/6/0/1/601a7806cbfad68196c43a4665871f8c3186802e.png" class="latex" alt="$6$" width="8" height="12" /> meters, and it takes her <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/c/e/5/ce5d3cbb9ab0a992ed503c2d4499e4f4af2f9d65.png" class="latex" alt="$36$" width="17" height="12" /> seconds longer to walk around the outside edge of the track than around the inside edge. What is Keiko's speed in meters per second?
