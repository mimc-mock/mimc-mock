<p>Brenda and Sally run in opposite directions on a circular track, starting at <a href="/wiki/index.php/Diameter" title="Diameter">diametrically</a> opposite points.  They first meet after Brenda has run 100 meters.  They next meet after Sally has run 150 meters past their first meeting point.  Each girl runs at a constant speed.  What is the length of the track in meters?
