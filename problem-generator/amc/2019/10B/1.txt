<p>Alicia had two containers. The first was <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/9/7/0/970ffc67a479e2152f649737fb6fa0acc4bb961f.png" class="latex" alt="$\tfrac{5}{6}$" style="vertical-align: -6px" width="9" height="21" /> full of water and the second was empty. She poured all the water from the first container into the second container, at which point the second container was <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/d/d/8/dd8646894f09910d68bdc1aabc0d22bb3e643194.png" class="latex" alt="$\tfrac{3}{4}$" style="vertical-align: -6px" width="9" height="21" /> full of water. What is the ratio of the volume of the first container to the volume of the second container?
