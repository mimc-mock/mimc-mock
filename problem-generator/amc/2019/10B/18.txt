<p>Henry decides one morning to do a workout, and he walks <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/d/d/8/dd8646894f09910d68bdc1aabc0d22bb3e643194.png" class="latex" alt="$\tfrac{3}{4}$" style="vertical-align: -6px" width="9" height="21" /> of the way from his home to his gym. The gym is <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/4/1/c/41c544263a265ff15498ee45f7392c5f86c6d151.png" class="latex" alt="$2$" width="8" height="12" /> kilometers away from Henry's home. At that point, he changes his mind and walks <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/d/d/8/dd8646894f09910d68bdc1aabc0d22bb3e643194.png" class="latex" alt="$\tfrac{3}{4}$" style="vertical-align: -6px" width="9" height="21" /> of the way from where he is back toward home. When he reaches that point, he changes his mind again and walks <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/d/d/8/dd8646894f09910d68bdc1aabc0d22bb3e643194.png" class="latex" alt="$\tfrac{3}{4}$" style="vertical-align: -6px" width="9" height="21" /> of the distance from there back toward the gym. If Henry keeps changing his mind when he has walked <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/d/d/8/dd8646894f09910d68bdc1aabc0d22bb3e643194.png" class="latex" alt="$\tfrac{3}{4}$" style="vertical-align: -6px" width="9" height="21" /> of the distance toward either the gym or home from the point where he last changed his mind, he will get very close to walking back and forth between a point <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/0/1/9/019e9892786e493964e145e7c5cf7b700314e53b.png" class="latex" alt="$A$" width="13" height="13" /> kilometers from home and a point <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/f/f/5/ff5fb3d775862e2123b007eb4373ff6cc1a34d4e.png" class="latex" alt="$B$" width="14" height="12" /> kilometers from home.
