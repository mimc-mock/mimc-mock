<p>Two farmers agree that pigs are worth <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/b/8/9/b899aba26cc33f0026125daebb44a60349c999b6.png" class="latex" alt="$300$" width="26" height="12" /> dollars and that goats are worth <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/b/4/3/b4328d77715c539955c57ce1aee7b7bc9cdea458.png" class="latex" alt="$210$" style="vertical-align: 0px" width="26" height="13" /> dollars. When one farmer owes the other money, he pays the debt in pigs or goats, with "change" received in the form of goats or pigs as necessary. (For example, a <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/1/7/2/172bf264a8b2c082be7f24b12296b09faaa2dfff.png" class="latex" alt="$390$" width="26" height="12" /> dollar debt could be paid with two pigs, with one goat received in change.) What is the amount of the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way?
