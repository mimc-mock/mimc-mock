<p>Joe and JoAnn each bought 12 ounces of coffee in a 16-ounce cup.  Joe drank 2 ounces of his coffee and then added 2 ounces of cream.  JoAnn added 2 ounces of cream, stirred the coffee well, and then drank 2 ounces.  What is the resulting ratio of the amount of cream in Joe's coffee to that in JoAnn's coffee?
